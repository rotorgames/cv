          This is probably one of the most popular Xamarin.Forms library so far.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I started this project as a way to bring popups in Xamarin.Forms. 

          I even couldn't imagine that the project would become so popular and achive more then [![NuGet Downloads](https://img.shields.io/nuget/dt/rg.plugins.popup?color=black&label=%20)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Rg.Plugins.Popup/){:target="_blank"} downloads and [![GitHub Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/rotorgames/rg.plugins.popup?color=black&label=%20)](https://github.com/rotorgames/Rg.Plugins.Popup){:target="_blank"} stars on GitHub.
          
          If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you to make one.

          This is a result of my passionate diving through algorithms.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          The library is an implementation of Eugene W. Myers's algorithm which allows finding differences and movements in collections.

          My goal was to bring a simple and powerful way at the same time to merge collections without useless redraws of UI in .NET

          I was inspired by AndroidX.DiffUtil when creating the library.

          Working at Shping I had the pleasure of getting to know technologies such as barcode scanning, drawing via SkiaSharp, machine learning with Google ML Kit, Blockchain, etc.

          Also, I bint a lot of libraries from java/objective-c to CSharp for internal usage, and developed an extension of Visual Studio For Mac which updates localizable resources.

          Shping is an amazing place where I can develop and discover new things.
